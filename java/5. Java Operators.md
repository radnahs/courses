  ## Java Operators



#### Java Arithmetic Operators



The way we calculate mathematical calculations, in the same way, Java provides arithmetic operators for mathematical operations. It provides operators for all necessary mathematical calculations.



Basic Arithmetic Operators

There are various arithmetic operators used in Java:

Operator | Meaning | Work

-------- | ------- | ----

+ | Addition | To add two operands.

- | Subtraction | To subtract two operands.

* | Multiplication | To multiply two operands.

/ | Division | To divide two operands.

% | Modulus | To get the area of the division of two operands.



Arithmetic operators are applied on integer and floating-point and not on boolean types. But you can use them on the characters' because, in Java, Char is sub-set of the integer.



Program to Show Arithmetic Operators Work

	public class arithop {

	 public static void main(String[] args) {
	  //Variables Definition and Initialization
	  int number1 = 12, number2 = 4;

	  //Addition Operation
	  int sum = number1 + number2;
	  System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);

	  //Subtraction Operation
	  int dif = number1 - number2;
	  System.out.println("Difference is : " + dif);

	  //Multiplication Operation
	  int mul = number1 * number2;
	  System.out.println("Multiplied value is : " + mul);

	  //Division Operation
	  int div = number1 / number2;
	  System.out.println("Quotient is : " + div);

	  //Modulus Operation
	  int rem = number1 % number2;
	  System.out.println("Remainder is : " + rem);
	 }

	}

	Output:
		Sum is: 16
		Difference is : 8
		Multiplied value is : 48
		Quotient is : 3
		Remainder is : 0
