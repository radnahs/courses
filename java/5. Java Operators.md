## Java Operators

#### Java Arithmetic Operators

The way we calculate mathematical calculations, in the same way, Java provides arithmetic operators for mathematical operations. It provides operators for all necessary mathematical calculations.

Basic Arithmetic Operators
There are various arithmetic operators used in Java:

Operator | Meaning | Work
-------- | ------- | ----
+| Addition | To add two operands.
-| Subtraction | To subtract two operands.
*| Multiplication | To multiply two operands.
/| Division | To divide two operands.
%| Modulus | To get the area of the division of two operands.

Arithmetic operators are applied on integer and floating-point and not on boolean types. But you can use them on the characters' because, in Java, Char is sub-set of the integer.

Program to Show Arithmetic Operators Work

	public class ArithmeticOperators {

	 	public static void main(String[] args) {
	  		//Variables Definition and Initialization
	  		int number1 = 12, number2 = 4;

	  		//Addition Operation
	  		int sum = number1 + number2;
	  		System.out.println("Sum is: " + sum);

	  		//Subtraction Operation
	  		int dif = number1 - number2;
	  		System.out.println("Difference is : " + dif);

	  		//Multiplication Operation
	  		int mul = number1 * number2;
	  		System.out.println("Multiplied value is : " + mul);

	  		//Division Operation
	  		int div = number1 / number2;
	  		System.out.println("Quotient is : " + div);

	  		//Modulus Operation
	  		int rem = number1 % number2;
	  		System.out.println("Remainder is : " + rem);
	 	}

	}

	Output:
		Sum is: 16
		Difference is : 8
		Multiplied value is : 48
		Quotient is : 3
		Remainder is : 0
    
In Java, unary arithmetic operators are used to increasing or decreasing the value of an operand. Increment operator adds 1 to the value of a variable, whereas the decrement operator decreases a value.

Increment and decrement unary operator works as follows:

	Syntax:
	 val++;
	 ++val;
	 val--;
	 --val;

These two operators have two forms: Postfix and Prefix. Both do increment or decrement in appropriate variables. These two operators can be placed before or after of variables. When it is placed before the variable, it is called prefix. And when it is placed after, it is called postfix.

Following example table, demonstrates the work of Increment and decrement operators with postfix and prefix:

Example | Description
------- | -----------
val = a++; | Store the value of "a" in "val" then increments.
val = a--; | Store the value of "a" in "val" then decrements.
val = ++a; | Increments "a" then store the new value of "a" in "val".
val = --a; | Decrements "a" then store the new value of "a" in "val".

	

#### Program to Show How Assignment Operators Work

	public class UnaryArithmeticOperators {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
	  		int r = 6;
	  		System.out.println("r=: " + r++);
			System.out.println("r=: " + r);

	  		int x = 6;
	  		System.out.println("x=: " + x--);
		  	System.out.println("x=: " + x);

			int y = 6;
		  	System.out.println("y=: " + ++y);

	  		int p = 6;
	  		System.out.println("p=: " + --p);

	 	}

	}

	output

	r=: 6
	r=: 7
	x=: 6
	x=: 5
	y=: 7
	p=: 5
