### Java Tokens
Java Tokens are the smallest individual building block or smallest unit of a Java program; the Java compiler uses it for constructing expressions and statements. Java program is a collection of different types of tokens, comments, and white spaces.

When we write a program, we need different important things. We require language tokens, white spaces, and formats.

There are various tokens used in Java:

#### Reserved Keywords
* Identifiers
* Literals
* Operators
* Separators
* White space is also considered as a token.

Keywords are words that have already been defined for Java compiler. They have special meaning for the compiler. Java Keywords must be in your information because you can not use them as a variable, class or a method name.

#### Java Reserved Keywords List
You can't use keyword as identifier in your Java programs, its reserved words in Java library and used to perform an internal operation.

abstract | assert | boolean | break
byte | case | catch | char
class | const | continue | default
do | double | else | enum
extends | final | finally | float
for | goto | if | implements
import | instanceof	int	interface
long | native | new | package
private	protected	public | return
short	static | strictfp | super
switch	synchronized | this | throw
throws | transient | try | void
volatile | while | true | false
null | 			

true, false and null are not reserved words but cannot be used as identifiers, because it is literals of built-in types.

Java operators are symbols that are used to perform mathematical or logical manipulations. Java is rich with built-in operators.

Operators are tokens that perform some calculations when they are applied to variables.

There are many types of operators available in Java such as:

* Arithmetic Operators
* Unary Arithmetic Operators
* Relational Operators
* Logical Operators
* Bitwise Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Compound Assignment Operators
* Conditional Operator
* instanceof Operator
* Member Selection or Dot Operator
